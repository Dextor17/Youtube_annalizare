Sir English or hindi plz use only one language..
"You guys must be ashamed of your thinking, someone is trying to give his best, but you are focusing on mistakes rather than his efforts,try to change your thinking,it doesn't mean if you speak English means you are the most brilliant,it's just a medium to convey our msg.."
But again it is creating redundancy..so how would you define it as normalization.???

"very good but sir one imp thing you have missed here is about primary key(PK).
 
In the original table PK was Eno.

Now instead keeping much redundancy in the same table, original table will be decomposed as  T1(Eno, Ename) and T2(Eno, Contact).

And

PK of T1 will be (Eno)
PK of T2 will be (Eno, Contact).

Thanks."
Thanks Sir
